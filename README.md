# BinSearchTemplate
A base template of binary search.  
Note: Binary search is only for **sorted** sequence.  
This version of binary search is only for **ascending sequence**.  
You may check using the is_sorted function in the C++ STL library.  
**Do not use this directly! This is only a template and it will not do security checks!**
